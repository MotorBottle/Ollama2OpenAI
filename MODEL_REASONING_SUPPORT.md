# Model Reasoning Support

**Languages:** English | [ÁÆÄ‰Ωì‰∏≠Êñá](MODEL_REASONING_SUPPORT.zh.md)

This document outlines the reasoning capabilities and supported `think` parameter values for different model families when using the Ollama2OpenAI gateway.

## Reasoning Parameter Support by Model Family

### üß† Full Reasoning Models (Support Effort Levels)

These models support fine-grained reasoning effort control with `"low"`, `"medium"`, and `"high"` levels:

| Model Family | Supported Values | Notes |
|--------------|------------------|-------|
| **GPT-OSS** | `"low"`, `"medium"`, `"high"` | Confirmed: Native support for reasoning effort levels |
| **Mistral Magistral** | `"low"`, `"medium"`, `"high"` | Confirmed: Via API system prompt integration |

**üìã Research Findings**:
- **DeepSeek-R1**: Uses automatic reasoning depth based on question complexity. No explicit effort levels found in documentation
- **QwQ**: Has `/think` and `/no_think` soft switches for reasoning control, but no effort levels documented

**Example Usage:**
```python
# High effort reasoning
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-oss:120b",
    reasoning_effort="high",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Solve this complex problem"}]
)

# Low effort for faster responses
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="deepseek-r1:14b",
    think="low",  # Direct Ollama format
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Simple question"}]
)
```

### ‚ö° Advanced Reasoning Models (Special Controls)

These models have sophisticated reasoning but use their own parameter systems:

| Model Family | Supported Values | Control Method |
|--------------|------------------|----------------|
| **DeepSeek-R1** | `true`, `false` | Automatic depth adjustment based on complexity |
| **QwQ** | `true`, `false`, `/think`, `/no_think` | Soft switches in prompts for reasoning control |

### üîÑ Basic Reasoning Models (True/False Only)

These models support reasoning but only in binary on/off mode:

| Model Family | Supported Values | Notes |
|--------------|------------------|-------|
| **Qwen3** | `true`, `false` | Confirmed: Binary reasoning control only |

**üìã Research Findings**:
- **Llama3 Base**: No native reasoning parameters. Reasoning achieved through specialized fine-tuning or system prompts
- **Standard Mistral Models**: No built-in reasoning (only Magistral series has reasoning)

**Example Usage:**
```python
# Enable reasoning (basic)
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="qwen3:32b",
    think=True,  # Only true/false supported
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Think about this problem"}]
)
```

### üö´ Non-Reasoning Models

These models do not support reasoning parameters:

| Model Family | Reasoning Support | Notes |
|--------------|-------------------|-------|
| **Llama2** | None | Standard completion model |
| **Code Llama** | None | Focused on code generation |
| **Embedding Models** | None | Text embedding models |

## Parameter Mapping Reference

### OpenAI Format ‚Üí Ollama Format

| Input Parameter | Full Reasoning Models | Basic Reasoning Models | Non-Reasoning Models |
|----------------|----------------------|------------------------|---------------------|
| `reasoning_effort: "minimal"` | `think: false` | `think: false` | Ignored |
| `reasoning_effort: "low"` | `think: "low"` | `think: true` | Ignored |
| `reasoning_effort: "medium"` | `think: "medium"` | `think: true` | Ignored |
| `reasoning_effort: "high"` | `think: "high"` | `think: true` | Ignored |

### Parameter Override Examples

```json
{
  "gpt-oss:120b": {
    "think": "high",
    "num_ctx": 32768,
    "temperature": 0.8
  },
  "qwen3:32b": {
    "think": true,
    "num_ctx": 8192,
    "temperature": 0.7
  },
  "llama2:7b": {
    "num_ctx": 4096,
    "temperature": 0.7
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

### üéØ Choosing Reasoning Effort

- **High Effort** (`"high"`): Complex problems requiring deep analysis
- **Medium Effort** (`"medium"`): Balanced reasoning for most tasks  
- **Low Effort** (`"low"`): Quick responses with basic reasoning
- **Minimal/False** (`false`): Fastest responses, no reasoning overhead

### ‚öôÔ∏è Performance Considerations

| Effort Level | Response Time | Token Usage | Best For |
|-------------|---------------|-------------|----------|
| `false` | Fastest | Lowest | Simple queries |
| `"low"` | Fast | Low | Quick reasoning tasks |
| `"medium"` | Moderate | Moderate | General problem solving |
| `"high"` | Slower | Higher | Complex analysis |

### üîß Model Selection Guide

1. **For Complex Reasoning**: Use GPT-OSS or DeepSeek-R1 with `"high"` effort
2. **For Simple Tasks**: Use Qwen3 with `true` for basic reasoning
3. **For Speed**: Use any model with `false` or no reasoning parameter
4. **For Code**: Use Code Llama (no reasoning needed)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Error: Invalid think parameter**: Model doesn't support effort levels, use `true`/`false`
- **No reasoning output**: Model doesn't support reasoning, or `think: false` is set
- **Slow responses**: High effort reasoning takes more time, consider lowering effort

### Testing Model Capabilities

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: Model capabilities may vary. Always test your specific models to confirm reasoning support.

```bash
# Test effort level support (try "low", "medium", "high")
curl -X POST http://localhost:22434/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-api-key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "your-model",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Test reasoning"}],
    "think": "high"
  }'

# Test basic reasoning support (true/false)
curl -X POST http://localhost:22434/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-api-key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "your-model", 
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Test reasoning"}],
    "think": true
  }'
```

**How to Interpret Results**:
- ‚úÖ **Success**: Model accepts parameter and provides reasoning content
- ‚ùå **Error 400**: Model doesn't support that parameter format
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **No reasoning content**: Model may not support reasoning even if parameter is accepted

üí° **Tip**: Always check your specific model's documentation for the most up-to-date reasoning capabilities, as model support may vary with different versions.
